# 2021_Nature_Comm_Nikolic_et_al_Correlation_analysis

This repository contains [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) and their dependencies to allow recreation of figure 7 in the manuscript (Correlation Matricies i.e. bubble plots), . 
The data was analyzed using [SAS](http://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html). We also provide a PDF version of the notebook.
Jupyter Notebooks support a growing number of [languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)


## Getting started

Code in this notebook relies on the use of SAS software, which is only accessible through a paid license.

-If you have SAS, then install the SAS Kernel for Jupyter Notebooks, [found here](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas_kernel).
-If you do not have access to SAS, there is a free version of it, currently called "SAS OnDemand for Academics: Studio" You can find out
more about that [here](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics/references/getting-started-with-sas-ondemand-foracademics-studio.html)

Regardless of your experience with or access to SAS, all of the data files used for this analysis are provided here, including the data derived
from SAS.


## Using this repository

For those who don't want to install SAS but still want to have a look at the code and its output we provided a PDF version of the notebook, along with all the input and output data files from this analysis.
